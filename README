Demonstrates basic parsing capabilities meant to faciliate writing/reading the command_t and command_stream_t structs.
Utilizes stack (from http://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/stack/array/) and postfix to implement the command structs.

Fails make check, had to comment out command from make-dist to allow make dist to succesfully run
