We are implementing part 1A with a Stack and trying to utilize PostFix to
determine the structure of the commands. We are hoping to place the commands
into a postfix array and group up the commands into their respective trees by
reading through the array and creating operator commands whenever we hit a
special command, e.g. &&, ||, |, ;, etc. Currently we only have tokens from the
input file outputting. We are having trouble implementing the stack and might have
to rewrite our own stack. Currently we are using another implementation that was found
online, which is sourced in the respective file, however there are compilation errors at times.
